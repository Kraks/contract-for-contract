%\todo{why? solidity is rather flexible, unsatisfying/weaker type system,
%not all invariants can be checked statically, e.g. the status of the chain}
%One \note{common} use case of higher-order functions in smart contracts is
%to express callback \todo{explain how it is used}.

%\todo{it is hard to enforce properties when callbacks exist}
%Static verification cannot completely address the issue here since
%transaction developers are oblivious to the user-provided callback.

%Building trustworthy and secure smart contract programs requires solid
%understanding and reliable enforcement of program invariants.

Smart contracts are programs to automate the execution of agreement so that all
parties involved in the agreement can be certain about the outcome.
Smart contracts are ``smart'' since by using blockchains they provide a
mechanism to \emph{ensure the economic outcome of transactions} without a
central authority.
A blockchain is a \note{XXX} that implements a consensus protocol of
Byzantine-fault-tolerant distributed ledgers.

It is however ironic that many popular smart contract languages, which hold the
great promise to ensure transactional outcomes via consensus and distributed
ledgers, do not provide enough means to \emph{ensure the computational outcomes},
leading to poor quality of programs.
Without ensuring the quality of programs, it is impossible to ensure
the economic outcome of transactions.

Indeed, we have seen a great number of notorious attacks to smart contract
systems in recent years.
For example, \todo{explain attack using callback}.
Attackers are able to utilize
the callback mechanism to \note{do crazy things and steal money}
The root cause of this attack is \todo{explain}.

Solidity does provide first-order assertion primitives (e.g. @require@ or
@modifier@) but they cannot effectively check function values, which are a
common pattern used in smart contract programs.
\zz{
On the other hand, assertion primitives are crucial for ensuring the accuracy and
integrity of a smart contract's business model.
}
\zz{
I'm not sure if this statement applies to the PL community, but from my
understanding, assertions are typically used during testing rather than runtime.
However, in smart contracts, these assertions function as guard conditions and can cause reverts if violated, making them extremely important.
}
Programmers have to manually insert such checks around relevant call-sites, \todo{which is bad}.
%Solidity also provides the @modifier@ mechanism that intercepts
%before and after a function call, thus can be used to check
%pre- and post-conditions.
%\todo{can we compose modifier?}
%\todo{can we attach modifier to callbacks?}
%\todo{can we use modifier to check function's argument?}

The lack of sufficient linguistic means to specify and enforce subtle behaviors
discourages programmers to use concise higher-level abstractions when writing
smart contract code.
Instead, to be secure, programmers are obliged to write verbose code with
lower-level abstractions, which conflates the main business logic and
behavioral checks, leading to poor readability and maintainability.
For instance, to defend the famous DAO attack \note{cite} caused by allowing
``reentrancy'' via external functions, programmers have to be extra cautious
about the execution order or maintain additional states to check if a call is
allowed. Either way is not ideal.
And often worse, defensive checks can be easily forgotten or disregarded,
leading to vulnerable code causing real monetary lose.

Apart from investigating effort to audit, certify, or verify smart contract programs,
language designers are responsible to empower programmers with better
linguistic solutions to secure smart contracts in the first place.
In this paper, we show that advanced \emph{behavioral software contracts} provide a
lightweight solution for securing \emph{smart contracts}.

\subsubsection*{\textbf{Behavioral Contracts for Smart Contracts}}
Behavioral contracts provide a mechanism for programmers to specify assumptions
and guarantees of software components. The specified assumptions and guarantees
will be monitored and reported when violated.
Pioneered by the Eiffel language \cite{DBLP:books/ph/Meyer91} and the
Design-by-Contract methodology \cite{DBLP:conf/tools/Meyer98a}, behavioral
contracts have been widely adopted in Java, Haskell, C\#, Python, Racket,
Elixir \cite{DBLP:conf/erlang/0001BBHMEF22}, etc. \todo{cite}

\todo{why BC is good here?}

At the conceptual level, behavioral contracts is complementary to smart
contracts, in the sense that they are both agreement -- between software
components for the former, and between transactional parties for the later.
Thus, the two terms ``contract'' indeed mean the same thing but just different
levels of enforcement.

In this work, we design and implement a practical extension of Solidity, the
most popular language for building smart contract programs. The extension
enriches the Solidity language with \emph{higher-order} and \emph{temporal}
behavioral contracts, which are absent in existing approaches.
\todo{allows furthermore downstream tasks, fuzzing, static verification,
	natural language to formal spec etc.}

\subsubsection*{\textbf{Contracts for Higher-Order Functions}}
Higher-order contracts provides a way to specify and enforce pre- and
post-conditions of untrusted functions. \todo{...}

\todo{restrict possible call targets}
\todo{why static verification fails}
\zz{address vs. function call?}

\subsubsection*{\textbf{Contracts for Temporal Properties}}
Temporal contracts provides a way to \todo{...}.
\todo{why static verification fails}


We develop a core model of the extension, including its syntax,
operational semantics, and discuss its soundness guarantee.
With this extension of higher-order temporal behavioral contracts, we examine
several cases of reported bugs and vulnerabilities and show that
our approach is effective in preventing these attacks.
\zz{Let's mention the amount of funds we could save if we can prevent these attacks.}
We also evaluate the overhead (gas consumption) of our approach
compared to manually inserted assertion checks, showing that \todo{...}

\subsubsection*{\textbf{Contributions}} This paper makes the following contributions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item We propose a specification of behavioral contracts for expressing and
	      enforcing higher-order and temporal properties for smart contracts.
	\item We design \lang, an extension for Solidity with
	      behavioral contracts, demonstrate its use cases through extensive examples,
	      and how it can improve the safety and reliability.
	\item We present the core formalization $\lambda_\lang$ for our proposed
	      extension, including its syntax, formal semantics, compilation, and
	      soundness.
	\item We examine a number of real-world attacks and show that our proposal is
	      effective in improving safety and reliability.
	\item We implement our approach on top of the existing Solidity compiler and shows
	      that its runtime overhead is marginal, therefore practical to use.
	\item \zz{Would open-sourcing be considered a contribution? Lol}
\end{itemize}
