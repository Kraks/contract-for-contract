In each individual swap, the caller determines either the amount of tokens sent to or received from the Pool, depending on the `kind` value. Returns an array with the net Vault asset balance deltas. Positive amounts represent tokens (or ETH) sent to the Vault, and negative amounts represent tokens (or ETH) sent by the Vault. Each delta corresponds to the asset at the same index in the `assets` array. Swaps are executed sequentially, in the order specified by the `swaps` array. Each array element describes a Pool, the token to be sent to this Pool, the token to receive from it, and an amount that is either `amountIn` or `amountOut` depending on the swap kind. Multihop swaps can be executed by passing an `amount` value of zero for a swap. This will cause the amount in/out of the previous swap to be used as the amount in for the current one. In a 'given in' swap, 'tokenIn' must equal the previous swap's `tokenOut`. For a 'given out' swap, `tokenOut` must equal the previous swap's `tokenIn`. The `assets` array contains the addresses of all assets involved in the swaps. These are either token addresses, or the IAsset sentinel value for ETH (the zero address). Each entry in the `swaps` array specifies tokens in and out by referencing an index in `assets`. Note that Pools never interact with ETH directly: it will be wrapped to or unwrapped from WETH by the Vault. Internal Balance usage, sender, and recipient are determined by the `funds` struct. The `limits` array specifies the minimum or maximum amount of each token the vault is allowed to transfer. `batchSwap` can be used to make a single swap, like `swap` does, but doing so requires more gas than the equivalent `swap` call.

The `tokens` and `minAmountsOut` arrays must have the same length, and each entry in these indicates the minimum token amount to receive for each token contract. The amounts to send are decided by the Pool and not the Vault: it just enforces these minimums. If exiting a Pool that holds WETH, it is possible to receive ETH directly: the Vault will do the unwrapping. To enable this mechanism, the IAsset sentinel value (the zero address) must be passed in the `assets` array instead of the WETH address. Note that it is not possible to combine ETH and WETH in the same exit. `assets` must have the same length and order as the array returned by `getPoolTokens`. This prevents issues when interacting with Pools that register and deregister tokens frequently. If receiving ETH however, the array must be sorted *before* replacing the WETH address with the ETH sentinel value (the zero address), which means the final `assets` array might not be sorted. Pools with no registered tokens cannot be exited. If `toInternalBalance` is true, the tokens will be deposited to `recipient`'s Internal Balance. Otherwise, an ERC20 transfer will be performed. Note that ETH cannot be deposited to Internal Balance: attempting to do so will trigger a revert. `minAmountsOut` is the minimum amount of tokens the user expects to get out of the Pool, for each token in the `tokens` array. This array must match the Pool's registered tokens. This causes the Vault to call the `IBasePool.onExitPool` hook on the Pool's contract, where Pools implement their own custom logic.

No action can ever cause a Pool's token `cash`, `managed` or `total` balance to be greater than 2^112 - 1. `lastChangeBlock` is the number of the block in which `token`'s total balance was last modified (via either a join, exit, swap, or Asset Manager update). This value is useful to avoid so-called 'sandwich attacks', for example when developing price oracles.

To enable this mechanism, the IAsset sentinel value (the zero address) must be passed in the `assets` array instead of the WETH address. Note that it is not possible to combine ETH and WETH in the same join. Any excess ETH will be sent back to the caller (not the sender, which is important for relayers). `assets` must have the same length and order as the array returned by `getPoolTokens`. This prevents issues when interacting with Pools that register and deregister tokens frequently. If sending ETH however, the array must be sorted *before* replacing the WETH address with the ETH sentinel value (the zero address), which means the final `assets` array might not be sorted. Pools with no registered tokens cannot be joined.

The arguments it receives are the same that an equivalent `batchSwap` call would receive. Unlike `batchSwap`, this function performs no checks on the sender or recipient field in the `funds` struct. This makes it suitable to be called by off-chain applications via eth_call without needing to hold tokens, approve them for the Vault, or even know a user's address.

Asset Managers can manage a Pool's tokens via `managePoolBalance`, depositing and withdrawing them directly, and can even set their balance to arbitrary amounts.

In each individual swap, the caller determines either the amount of tokens sent to or received from the Pool, depending on the `kind` value. Returns an array with the net Vault asset balance deltas. Positive amounts represent tokens (or ETH) sent to the Vault, and negative amounts represent tokens (or ETH) sent by the Vault. Each delta corresponds to the asset at the same index in the `assets` array. Swaps are executed sequentially, in the order specified by the `swaps` array. Each array element describes a Pool, the token to be sent to this Pool, the token to receive from it, and an amount that is either `amountIn` or `amountOut` depending on the swap kind. Multihop swaps can be executed by passing an `amount` value of zero for a swap. This will cause the amount in/out of the previous swap to be used as the amount in for the current one. In a 'given in' swap, 'tokenIn' must equal the previous swap's `tokenOut`. For a 'given out' swap, `tokenOut` must equal the previous swap's `tokenIn`. The `assets` array contains the addresses of all assets involved in the swaps. These are either token addresses, or the IAsset sentinel value for ETH (the zero address). Each entry in the `swaps` array specifies tokens in and out by referencing an index in `assets`. Note that Pools never interact with ETH directly: it will be wrapped to or unwrapped from WETH by the Vault. Internal Balance usage, sender, and recipient are determined by the `funds` struct. The `limits` array specifies the minimum or maximum amount of each token the vault is allowed to transfer. `batchSwap` can be used to make a single swap, like `swap` does, but doing so requires more gas than the equivalent `swap` call.

The `tokens` and `minAmountsOut` arrays must have the same length, and each entry in these indicates the minimum token amount to receive for each token contract. The amounts to send are decided by the Pool and not the Vault: it just enforces these minimums. If exiting a Pool that holds WETH, it is possible to receive ETH directly: the Vault will do the unwrapping. To enable this mechanism, the IAsset sentinel value (the zero address) must be passed in the `assets` array instead of the WETH address.
