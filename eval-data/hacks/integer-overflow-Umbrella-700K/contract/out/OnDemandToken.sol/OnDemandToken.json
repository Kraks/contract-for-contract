This means\\n * that a supply mechanism has to be added in a derived contract using {_mint}.\\n * For a generic mechanism see {ERC20PresetMinterPauser}.\\n *\\n * TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide\\n * https://forum.zeppelin.solutions/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How\\n * to implement supply mechanisms].\\n *\\n * We have followed general OpenZeppelin guidelines: functions revert instead\\n * of returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless conventional\\n * and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications.\\n *\\n * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.\\n * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just\\n * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit\\n * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.\\n *\\n * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}\\n * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting\\n * allowances.
