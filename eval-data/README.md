This repository contains the experiment results of submission
_Consolidating Smart Contracts with Behavioral Contracts_ (1220).

## Structure

- The `solythesis` folder contains benchmark programs that are adapted from Li et al. (PLDI 20). These programs are used to evaluate gas efficiency of our approach (Section 7, Table 3).

- The `hack` folder contains benchmark programs, compiled bytecode, and transaction data collected from real-world attacks. These programs are used in the case studies (Section 6, Table 1) and in the evaluation of gas efficiency (Section 7, Table 2).
